# Promises and Error Handling Challenge
You are developing an e-commerce dashboard that fetches data from various APIs, including a product catalog, user reviews, and a sales report. Each API call could potentially fail due to network issues, incorrect endpoints, or data inconsistencies. To build a stable and user-friendly application, you need to manage these scenarios with proper error handling.

Critical Thinking Questions
Why is it important to handle errors for each individual API call rather than just at the end of the promise chain?
How does using custom error classes improve debugging and error identification?
When might a retry mechanism be more effective than an immediate failure response?
